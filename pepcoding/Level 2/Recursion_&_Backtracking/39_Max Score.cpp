// 1. You are given a list of words, a list of alphabets(might be repeating) and score of every alphabet 
//      from a to z.
// 2. You have to find the maximum score of any valid set of words formed by using the given 
//      alphabets.
// 3. A word can not be used more than one time.
// 4. Each alphabet can be used only once. 
// 5. It is not necessary to use all the given alphabets.

// Note -> Check out the question video and write the recursive code as it is intended without 
//                changing signature. The judge can't force you but intends you to teach a concept.
