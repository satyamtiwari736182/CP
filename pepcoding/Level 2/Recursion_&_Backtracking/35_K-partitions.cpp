// 1. You are given two integers n and k, where n represents number of elements and k represents 
//      number of subsets.
// 2. You have to partition n elements in k subsets and print all such configurations.

// Note -> Check out the question video and write the recursive code as it is intended without 
//                changing signature. The judge can't force you but intends you to teach a concept.
