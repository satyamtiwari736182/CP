// 1. You are given an array of n integers.
// 2. You have to divide these n integers into 2 subsets such that the difference of sum of two subsets 
//      is as minimum as possible.
// 3. If n is even, both set will contain exactly n/2 elements. If  is odd, one set will contain (n-1)/2 and 
//     other set will contain (n+1)/2 elements.
// 3. If it is not possible to divide, then print "-1".

// Note -> Check out the question video and write the recursive code as it is intended without 
//                changing signature. The judge can't force you but intends you to teach a concept.
