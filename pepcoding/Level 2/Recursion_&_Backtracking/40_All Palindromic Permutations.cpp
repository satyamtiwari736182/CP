// 1. You are given a string of length n.
// 2. You have to print all the palindromic permutations of the given string.
// 3. If no palindromic permutation exists for the given string, print "-1".

// Note -> Check out the question video and write the recursive code as it is intended without 
//                changing signature. The judge can't force you but intends you to teach a concept.
