// 1. You are given an integer n, which represents n friends numbered from 1 to n.
// 2. Each one can remain single or can pair up with some other friend.
// 3. You have to print all the configurations in which friends can remain single or can be paired up.

// Note -> Check out the question video and write the recursive code as it is intended without 
//                changing signature. The judge can't force you but intends you to teach a concept.
