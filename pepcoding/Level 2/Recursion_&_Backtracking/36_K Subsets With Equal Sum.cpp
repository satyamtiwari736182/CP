// 1. You are given an array of n distinct integers.
// 2. You have to divide these n integers into k non-empty subsets such that sum of integers of every 
//      subset is same.
// 3. If it is not possible to divide, then print "-1".

// Note -> Check out the question video and write the recursive code as it is intended without 
//                changing signature. The judge can't force you but intends you to teach a concept.
