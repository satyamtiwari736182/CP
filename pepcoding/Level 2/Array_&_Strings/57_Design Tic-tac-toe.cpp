// Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an n x n board between two players:

// A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
// Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed.
// A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
// Implement the TicTacToe class:

// TicTacToe(int n) Initializes the object the size of the board n.
// int move(int row, int col, int player) Indicates that the player with id player plays at the cell (row, col) of the board. The move is guaranteed to be a valid move.
