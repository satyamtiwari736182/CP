  [10] Dijkstra Algorithm [Prio.Queue][single source sortest path] [O(v^3logV)]
  [11] Bellmanford Algorithm.[Single_Source_Sortest_Path {O(VE)}][but when applied for every node it becomes "all pair shortest path algorithm"][Can Also detect ve- weight cycle]

- Number of Edges(e) = vC2 -> O(v^2)
  e = O(v^2)
  v = O( log e )
