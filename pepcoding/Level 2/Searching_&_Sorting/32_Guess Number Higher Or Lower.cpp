// 1. We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
// 2. I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
// 3. Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
// 4. You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns 3 possible results:
//    a) -1: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e. pick < num).
//    b) 1: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e. pick > num).
//    c). 0: The number I picked is equal to your guess (i.e. pick == num).
// 5. Return the number that I picked.
