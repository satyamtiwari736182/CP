// 1. Winter is coming! During the contest, your first job is to design a standard heater with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.
// 2. Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range. 
// 3. Given the positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, return the minimum radius standard of heaters so that those heaters could cover all houses.
// 4. Notice that all the heaters follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will the same.
