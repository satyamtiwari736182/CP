// 1. You are given a N*N chessboard and the starting position of the knight in the chessboard.
// 2. The rows and columns are 0 indexed, so the top-left square is (0, 0), and the bottom-right square is (N-1, N-1).
// 3. You have to find the probability of knight to remain in the chessboard after exactly k number of moves.

// Note -> The knight continues moving until it has made exactly K moves or has moved off the chessboard.
