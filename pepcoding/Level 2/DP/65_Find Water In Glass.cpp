// 1. Pepcoder arranged some glasses in the form of pascal triangle.
// 2. Capacity of each glass is 1 litre. If you pour K amount of water in a glass, it will retain 1 litre and
//    rest of it gets equally distributed in left bottom glass and right bottom glass.
// 3. If pepcoder pours K litres of water in the topmost glass, you have to find out the amount of water in Cth glass of Rth row.

// Assumption -> There are enough glasses in the triangle till no glass overflows.
