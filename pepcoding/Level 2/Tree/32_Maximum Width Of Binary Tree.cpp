// 1. Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum width of the given tree.
// 2. The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.
// 3. The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.
