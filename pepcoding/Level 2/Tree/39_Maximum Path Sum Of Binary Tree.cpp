// 1. You are given a partially written function to solve.

// 2. You are required to complete the body of maxPathSum function. The function is expected to return Integer value depending upon node-to-node paths where path sum equals targetSum.

// 3. A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

// 4. The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
