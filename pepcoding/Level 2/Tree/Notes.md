Types of Problems

- [1] Building trees.
- [2] Views of trees.
- [3] Node to root Path
  => Problem on Paths.
  -> Types:
  i. Single Path: check ans from left or right, if found return the same ans immediately.
  ii. All Path: check ans from left and right, if fond store the ans[both] return at the end. Let all possible solution is explored.

- [4] Diameter of tree.
  -> Ways:
  i. Naive Approach: for each node find solution from scratch.
  ii. DP on Trees: build ans and store it and then return result the val for parent node to build ans, and so on.

- [4] LCA.
- [6] Count min camera required to cover the tree
