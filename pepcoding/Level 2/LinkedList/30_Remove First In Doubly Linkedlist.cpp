// 1. You are given a partially written DoublyLinkedList class.
// 2. You are required to complete the body of removeFirst function. This function is supposed to add an element to the front of LinkedList.
// 3. If size of list is zero then return "ListIsEmpty: -1".
// 4. You are required to update head, tail and size as required.
// 5. Input and Output is managed for you. Just update the code in removeFirst function.

// Note -> Use the code snippet and follow the algorithm discussed in question video. The judge can
//         force you but the intention is to teach a concept. Play in spirit of the question.
