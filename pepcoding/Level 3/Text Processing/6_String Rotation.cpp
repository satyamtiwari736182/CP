// Three Programmers at Pepcoding invented an amusing game. First Pepcoder thought out a string S and passed it to the Second Pepcoder. The Second Pepcoder executed X (0< X < string length) cyclic shifts ( a cyclic shift is a transfer of the last character of the string to the beginning of this string) with this string. As a result of these operations, a string T was produced, and the Second Pepcoder passed it to the Third Pepcoder. The task of the Third Pepcoder was to find the number X or make sure that the Second Pepcoder was mistaken because the string T could not be produced from the string S via cyclic shifts.

// Expected complexity: O(n)
