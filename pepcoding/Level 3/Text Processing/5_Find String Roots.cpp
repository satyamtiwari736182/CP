// In mathematics, the N-th root of a number M, is a number K such that K^N=M, i.e. KKK...K=M where k is multiplied N times.
// Given a string S you have to find the maximum N such that the N-th root of S exists.
// For ex :
// If S= "sumsumsumsum",  for N=2 the string T="sumsum" is the N-th root of S, While for N=4 its N-th root is T= "sum".  
// The actual answer would be 4, because there is no N-th root of S="sumsumsumsum" for N>4.

// Note that for N=1 any string S is the N-th root of itself.
