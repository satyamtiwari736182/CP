// Mr. Pepcoder has an array A, and his Friend love to do operations on the
// array. The operations can be a query or an update.

// For each query the Friend say two indices l and r , and their father answers back with the sum
// of the elements from indices l to r (both included).

// When there is an update, the friend says an index i and a value x , and Pepcoder will add x to
// ith index of array (so the new value of arr[i]  is arr[i] + x ).

// Because indexing the array from zero is too obscure for children, all indices start from 1.
