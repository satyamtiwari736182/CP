// Alice and Bob play a game.

// They start with a number n and play in turns. In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:
// 1. Divide n by any of its odd divisors greater than 1.
// 2. Subtract 1 from n if n is greater than 1.


// Divisors of a number include the number itself.
// The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.
// Alice moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.
